            "{'comment_text': 'First off.  Very nice.  Apple has put a lot of nice tech into this.  Here is my issue.. The Price.  My $400 Meta Quest 2 can do a lot of what was shown.  I haven&#39;t played with the Meta Quest 3, cuz I am cheap and I cannot just by this tech without getting in trouble, but I cannot compare the Apple passthrough with the Meta Quest 3.  Quest 2 is monochrome and has some issues.  But if you close one eye, you are good.  :)  Anyway, looks awesome, but at 3 - 4K, it better be a full computer.  Microsoft failed with their high end VR/AR, sorry Apple Mixed Reality, headset with this as well.  Minus the military option..  Again, anyway.  Apple got to use years of other headset trials to come out with theirs.  Looks really nice, but the price point is always the issue.  Looks amazing and the tech in it is great.  But am I going to spend 10x the price for it...  Or depending on what you are willing to do, 3-4 times.  I am very happy with the Meta Quest 2.  I am not a Facebook fan, but damn...  They figured it out.  Microsoft had it, and as always, dropped the ball.  Gave up just before it was good.  No idea what is going on there.  I loved the idea of Windows everywhere.  I loved the Microsoft cell phone.  Windows CE on my cell phone was awesome!  Played Space Quest on it.  I was so happy.  And the initial Microsoft Phone application..  Handset sucked, but the rest of it was cool.  But then Microsoft just failed to deliver, and in my weird opinion, Apple is great at seeing a threat.  Killing it and then doing it themselves years later really well...  It sucks to remember.  Anyway, I would love to do a Meta Quest 2 to Apple Vision Pro comparison with you Marques.   Or do it yourself and hit me up for some suggestions.  Of course Apple can come to market with a really slick device years after other people have put the work in.  But is it better, especially when price point is involved?  I don&#39;t know.  I see a lot of what is already available.  Yes, Meta put the line in the interface so you know what you are going to &quot;click&quot;.  Is removing that line and hoping you interact with the object you want to better?  I don&#39;t know...  Love it, but price point makes me question.  And no off button... Come on...  Disconnect your power source so your LIPO batter doesn&#39;t fully discharge and possibly blow up.. Ok, you need to really mistreat your battery for that to happen..  But still.  Meta gives you the option to turn off.  I like options.  I like not 3-4K price point.  Meta just works and I can attach a cable if I want longer battery life..  Is the Apple Vision Pro actually work 4000 bucks..  I dunno....

Even though each eye has a bit more than 4K resolution, it&#39;s not nearly enough to provide a 4K window within that space of its FOV. This means you actually only end up getting closer to 1080, if even that. Only way to get closer to 4K (but still not there) is blowing up the virtual display to take up the entire FOV (at least the horizontal dimension), which would not be comfortable, at which point if you were sitting that close to a 4K display it would be uncomfortable and the resolution would not be great.

This is was my first time watching a Apple M.R glasses and i&#39;m very satisfied and what to expect if i had one. <br><br>I would like to give my side of things. I&#39;ve been dreaming with a VR headset for 18 years or so. I remember when i was a kid seeing about how VR reality would be a more popular thing in the future. In that time they were developing the Oculus Rift i guess. It was like imagining going to the Moon. That&#39;s how far i was from even dreaming about one of those devices. Last year i realized my dream and i bought a Quest 2. I always watched Youtube videos about it, thousands of reviews and such. But nothing is comparable to wearing it and seeing it in person. It&#39;s a experience out of this world. And for the amazement of myself, i didn&#39;t see anyone saying bad things about it. It was very strange to think that something can be so positive on every angle. When i got it, it was everything i was expecting. <br><br>So after watching this and even if i had $5000 thousand dollars to buy it, i would prefer to buy a new Quest. This Apple device really goes beyound in terms of image quality and resolution. I can&#39;t argue about that.  Quest has a lower resolution because they wanted to make something that could become more popular and not restrited to a certain class of people. It&#39;s very accessible, even for me that live in Brazil, where everything is expensive as ***. <br><br>But as this Apple is a Mixed reality device, it lacks a lot of features and freedom that Quest 2 has. In the second option, i can have a lot of interactions in both modes. I can install a lot of apps and do whatever i want. For example: i can install a new browser and navegate the internet on a different way. I can install hundreds of thousands of games which i couldn&#39;t find anywhere else, i can connect to my computer and play a lot of games directly and wireless. There&#39;s a lot of options. Without mentioning the fact that i can connect Quest to any computer. I can extend the battery duration easily, because my external battery can last up to 6 hours i guess, or even more, even though i won&#39;t stay that longer. On Quest 2, i can also change from hand tracking to controller tracking which is awesome.<br><br>I was expecting you to mention a controller or how to play a game on it. Besides the price, it&#39;s a big not. And for the ones who might have money to afford it, at least you know how far you can go with it.', 'author': '@a.thiago3842', 'likes': 0, 'timestamp': '2024-02-04T21:52:46Z'}\n",

            "{'comment_text': 'Very cool. I got the 2nd version of the HTC vive about ~8 years ago. It was cool... for a few hours. Not to mention the set up for it was insane. It had so many cables, and the VR sensors were basically big blocks which you had to drill into the corners of whatever room you were using it in, so once you set up a room, it&#39;s not feasible to constantly redrill the sensors everywhere. Not to mention the screen inside wasn&#39;t the best. You definitely had that sense of &quot;yeah i&#39;m looking through a vr headset right now&quot;. Now we have the metaquest, and the apple vision. The coolest part of this device is the ability to select things using a combination of your eyes and making hand gestures. I can&#39;t say that I&#39;d ever be inclined to wear one of these out in public without feeling like an absolute tool, though.<br><br>I feel like the only time I&#39;d actually use this is if I wanted to watch a movie while in my home, but wanted to feel like I was in an actual movie theater. The pairing of the computer and headset is also cool.  The facetiming features and VR environments are all cool, but not worth thousands of dollars. When VR can make you feel like your standing in a different environment with no hint of a screen which you&#39;re actually looking at, and it becomes affordable to the average person, then I will probably be getting one. Maybe in 5 years when everything has improved... pixel resolution, true lighting, no bulky embarrassing design, response time, battery life, eye tracking, hand tracking. You saw the blurs on his body when he looked at himself in the VR world, right? As time progresses, that will become less and less blurry until it is nearly indistinguishable from looking at your hand in real life. I&#39;m going to wait for that to happen. But not only that, but there has to be an amazing game of the decade to release on it, a game everyone is gushing over like they are currently doing with Palworld. Maybe a game that integrates the game into the real world, like pokemon go. Or maybe an MMORPG which is half in the real world and half in VR. Something like that, just such an amazing VR game, and great game overall... otherwise it would just be a gimmick, as it is right now.<br><br>Side note - It seems like over the past 30 days two new trends have become popular.

            "{'comment_text': 'Bummer that you can’t get more than 1 screen for the virtual desktop at once, especially because the resolution on the headset is finally high enough to be able to display text crisply and in 4k resolution. Hope they add in a multi-monitor option soon as either an update or in subsequent generations as that will truly change the game and justify more widespread adoption in people’s minds.<br><br>I was one of those people who was really into the whole VR thing in the early days, and bought an OG Occulus Rift. While the gaming on it was cool, I felt what would really bridge the gap between VR as a novelty and as a truly useful new technology would be whether it could be used as a productivity booster for computer work. There’s an app called “virtual desktop” for the Occulus which enabled you to create multiple virtual monitors, and I was so excited to try it for schoolwork (e.g., having a pdf open on one screen and a notes doc in the other). I was really bummed when I found out that the Occulus Rift’s resolution wasn’t quite high enough to be able to display text in a crisp and easily readable way. But I held out hope that someday we’d get there. <br><br>With the Vision Pro, it looks like we’ve finally gotten to the point where the VR display resolution is high enough that text and pictures are easy to see (i.e., that looking at a virtual monitor is like looking at a real one). What would be incredible for productivity would be if you could have multiple screens open, maybe even at different distances (e.g., you could create the equivalent of a movie theater screen with a presentation or video on it while also having a smaller screen in front of you that would be like a laptop on your lap for notes and maybe one more screen off to the side with a storyboard (if you’re making a video), or potential pics to include in a presentation, so you can swap them in and see what they look like on the “big screen”). <br><br>For most people, it’s hard to justify buying a $3k product just for fun. The only way where I see people actually shelling out $3k for a VR product is if they can somehow justify it as boosting their day to day productivity at work or in their business. Kinda similar to how, while the iPhone was considered really expensive when it first came out, lots of people saw that it could really boost their work productivity vs a non-smart phone and bought it', 'author': '@stephensands3485', 'likes': 0, 'timestamp': '2024-02-04T16:55:44Z'}\n",

A few reflexes (like pointing vs. gesturing) need to be &quot;unlearned&quot; but nothing complicated.<br>4) Immersive experience is incredible. From nature scenes to live games (my favorite is the Inter Miami CF film), the sensation is amazing.<br>5) Feels lighter than the Meta Quest Pro and I think it is (650g vs. 722g).<br><br>Minus:<br>1) Still very heavy. Can&#39;t imagine watching a full blown movie/game with it.<br>2) Battery is just weird. I understand why it&#39;s needed but it&#39;s a really cumbersome addition.<br>3) Audio is quiet. Many have talked about taking it on airplanes. I don&#39;t think that use-case will feel as good as it sounds: the built-in speakers are too quiet to make it a truly immersive experience (video+audio).<br>4) Price! I get it. It&#39;s a V1 product. But it&#39;s $3,500 before tax. Depending what your local tax is, this could go about $4,000.<br>5) It&#39;s really a better Meta Quest.

People, the ONLY thing that will sell any of that product will never be Face Time or Spatial Audio or whatever boring stuff can look just a tiny bit more futuristic. It&#39;s GAMES!!! I know, Apple and Games. Well, there is your problem. This is why this will not take off. Nobody will pay 3k just to have a more immersive Face Time. Oh, well, possibly the Apple Fan Boys/Girls that buy everything for any price as long as it has an Apple logo on it. The biggest customer base for VR are Gamers. The second biggest (and that is already smaller by a factor of 1000 at least) are engineers. You want to sell VR, you need games that use it really well. The tech is good, even the price is OK for Gamers. When you sink 5k-10k into your system, another 3k is manageable. And it will go down over time. Oh, wait, it&#39;s Apple...OK, so it will be the same price even if it is outdated^^ \\r<br>Selling VR of that quality to a non-gamer base is like selling fridges in Antarctica. This will be why this will not take off. Gamers will not switch to Apple just for the tech. They will wait for others on their platform to get to that level. \\r<br>\\r<br>I admire the tech and what can be done with it...but I lament that is wasted on 99.9% of Apple users.

The power on/off idea is ridiculous, and you would think the weight balance would have been taken more into account... I really don&#39;t know who their target demographic is with this one. How will it justify production cost, and/or long-term use? Gonna be interesting to see play out. My prediction is, it doesn&#39;t do too great, and will likely see a discontinuance... Most VR users (that&#39;s what it is, sue me Apple) are interested in the gaming aspect, and the other areas of productivity haven&#39;t really been tapped, save for enterprise spaces. This one defies logic for me...<br><br>Edit: I should give a positive though too, to be balanced. I like the idea of the sensors, including Lidar, eye and face tracking. I also like the IDEA of their passthrough, and the built-in ventilation fan/exhaust. These are not, however, core components that others can&#39;t implement just as easily.

Instead just have a few thin layers of some sort of clear LED screens. But these have to be very thin. You could layer the rgb pixels to maybe give a little more depth perception and color mixing tho idk how that stuff completely works or if that already exists, probably does. Next we&#39;d need to shrink down the cameras and sensors. Thats gonna be the extra hard part. How would you shrink down all the components for those? We could possibly somehow just &quot;stretch out&quot; or &quot;spaghettify&quot; the sensors to fit into the frame. For the cameras that could just mean stretching out the lens distances, shapes, and quantity in the sides of the classes going towards the ears. so instead of having everything compact into this little cube/ball/ whatever tf, for the cameras, its basically just turned into a few thin long lines.

They knew this as well on account of the &quot;virtual display&quot; feature being a thing. They implemented a feature... to give you all the stuff the Apple Vision is missing... and you just end up using a different Apple device instead of <b>actually</b> using the Vision Pro. If I pay $3,500+ for a device, I shouldn&#39;t have <b>standard applications be missing</b> or have to connect it to another multi-thousand dollar device to get all the features that the Vision just straight up doesn&#39;t have. I get that it&#39;s the Apple Ecosystem and they want you to exclusively use their products, but <b>come on.</b> The Index even has a faster refresh rate of 120hz with an experimental 144hz and backwards-compatible to 90hz, the Vision Pro only goes up to 100hz <b>max</b> but runs at a standard 90hz.<br>Also, an app like &quot;Jigsaw&quot; is something that already exists as a VR game and is way more fun and enjoyable, called &quot;Disassembly VR&quot;. Even better, you can already do Virtual Passthrough Theaters with the Index and have just as enjoyable of an experience. Hell, I watched all of Infinity War with the Index and had a great time with amazing sound and resolution, all the while feeling like I was in my living room with passthrough. Not to mention the full Index kit is more than a <b>third</b> of the price of the Vision Pro at $1,000 for the entire set.<br><br>This is... the biggest waste of resources Apple has ever invested in. Ever. They built up all this hype of this headset being the future, and they put out... a worse version of a 2019 VR headset at triple the value. It&#39;s not even actual AR like they originally advertised it as (the passthrough eyes were clearly implying this as well when the product was first announced and there was little-to-no information yet, the eyes not even looking right makes this even more hilarious). This isn&#39;t an Apple Virtual Reality Headset, this is an Apple Peripheral that just &quot;enhances&quot; your current devices and nothing else. Literally the only remotely interesting thing here is the Beta &quot;Persona&quot; feature, but Digital Reconstruction isn&#39;t anything new, all modern iPhones have the same facial recognition tech, the Vision Pro just lets you see the 3D scan result. Quite literally toting year-old software as brand new tech.<br><br>This thing is just... a glass bottle of sparkling water. It&#39;s fancy, but.. it&#39;s nothing new.<br>In the words of The Verge: &quot;It&#39;s magic until it&#39;s not&quot;. The Index is just pure magic, those controllers are still mindboggling (you can unironically watch your fingers twitch in the game, the controllers are that sensitive).<br><br>P.S, this is part of their &quot;Pro&quot; line of products? <b>Really?</b> This is what they consider <b>&quot;PROFESSIONAL.&quot;</b>', 'author': '@allthenamesiwantedweretaken', 'likes': 0, 'timestamp': '2024-02-03T21:10:50Z'}\n",

I just want these headsets to have an incredible image for gaming, and not cost $4000.

Can you use it as a full-time phone with a sim card what is the 3000 dollars for is it to be apart of apples eco system. this must be not geared towards the average consumer this will die out as competition increases. once Samsung and Google release theirs they could easily have a Bluetooth function that could allow any computer to do what Apple did with the Mac. if Samsung uses Google having a Google app that allows you to use your computer keyboard to type on the headset is easy. google already offers device pairing when you are online you can easily send what you were viewing on Google Chrome to other devices. I am not getting the price tag. just understand this is about 3 iPhones or, one Mac and a phone in price maybe even an Apple watch as well if you opt for the low-budget devices. this is almost the price of two 65 Samsung middle-class 4k TVs. for a headset that does everything that the Samsung headset did with 5-6 years newer tech Apple ecosystem and a few camera gimmicks while Samsung was being offered for free with phone purchases.. I got its Apple and when I first saw it I really wanted one but after the review, i really don&#39;t see the 3k wow factor this headset could easily be beaten. The only thing i will say about it is the front display is a neat trick and would make you question a legitimate hey this is one of one but even that doesn&#39;t work as a 100% amazing new thing it looks like a first generation we will eventually get there item.', 'author': '@RICHCREWSPLASHSET', 'likes': 0, 'timestamp': '2024-02-03T16:39:59Z'}\n",

Apple&#39;s arrogance is why I stopped buying their products in 2012 and moved to Android. Spatial computing? My a**. This is a glorified VR Headset with the &quot;Apple tax&quot;. I tried a PSVR2, with eye tracking. It made me vomit. I bought a Quest 3, was able to use for a week, then returned. This thing is a Quest 3 with the PSVR2 eye tracking which I found pretty useless. Foveal rendering was such a bummer, things looked blurry overall. This product is pathetic. The Quest 3 was already feeling heavy even with a top strap to support itself on the skull. This is over 600 grams!? God, I can&#39;t imagine how tiring it will feel.

I can&#39;t believe something that doesn&#39;t even have YouTube on it as a native app costs 4k and someone&#39;s impressed with it because of a &quot;persona&quot;, you know, how about a video call so you can see the original person and not have this on the face? The fake eyes are clearly awful, and Apple clearly misled consumers with their marketing because it&#39;s nothing like it. The lady on the marketing material is also black, and she has perfect-looking fake eyes on the external screen. This VR headset is just trash and does nothing the Quest 3 couldn&#39;t do. The Quest 3 even allowed me to connect to my PC wirelessly, or I could use a £19, 16-ft long USB-C cable. I also purchased corrective lenses for the Quest 3 and it made the screen super sharp. It&#39;s incredible how YouTubers like yourself are trying to find something positive to say about this device when it&#39;s really, really overpriced.<br><br>How major developers are avoiding this platform is a telltale sign of their belief in it. It&#39;s a gimmick. As a 1st generation product this thing sucks and should cost £700-800 at most, just like how the 1st iPad, and the 1st Apple Watch costed less at realease.<br><br>This is pretty much why I stopped reviewing on YouTube.

The same with the overdesign of the battery pack - what is wrong with them using usb-c. This would have meant you could power it from the mains for when you are sat at a desk or watching a movie - you can then switch to battery mode if you need to be more mobile.<br>The major issue is the lack of VR gaming - and because theyve gone all in with hand and eye tracking it means all the VR games that don&#39;t use hand tracking will never be compatible unless the devs change that (which most wont).<br>It looks well built and i&#39;m sure it&#39;s great for watching movies -- but because it runs on an OS based off ipadOS it has the same limitations the ipad has... no desktop apps!!! You have a $3500 device that is capable of running like a laptop but needs a laptop/computer to run desktop apps (it&#39;s similar to the psvr2 needing the ps5). <br>For $3500 for a spatial computer i would expect it to run full desktop apps NOT ipad versions. I&#39;d expect it to play VR games with option controllers. I&#39;d expect it to run on battery and mains. i&#39;d also expect nothing to be in beta and for it to be practically perfect out the box. The fact a $500 meta quest can do things this can&#39;t and can manage to do other things reasonably well shows that apple have over engineered this device (sadly since the death of Jobs Apple have slowly been going down hill because they are all over the place... it reminds me of how apple was before Jobs came back...they are throwing so many things out there to flood the market with dated products, overpriced products, etc... i miss the days when you knew you were getting the best of Apple instead of half-baked overpriced products pretending to be something they are not).', 'author': '@paul28177', 'likes': 0, 'timestamp': '2024-02-03T10:56:59Z'}\n",

No included controllers for apps that require more inputs than eye and hand tracking; no must-have apps at the moment; no indication that it will sell well enough at its price point to encourage significant app development in the future; similar battery life and seemingly less comfort for extended wear compared to the current leading headset at 5x the price...<br><br>The only real use case I can see for the AVP right now is browsing the web or watching videos, and even then there are major gaps in app support. I&#39;m sure the screen is nice, I&#39;m sure the eyetracking is cool, I&#39;m sure the spatial anchoring is well-executed, but functionally I could do all of that well enough - along with a lot more - with a Quest 3 and still have enough money left over to buy a huge OLED TV.

Wh is the measurement of how many energy is packed inside the battery because at the end of the day you are comparing how much energy can this battery provide! mAh is only relevant when two systems run on the same voltage, which in many cases is not the case. Higher voltage can provide the benefit of using less amperage given the total power (wattage) is the same, actually it’s better in the sense it generates less heat (less energy loss). In this case of AVP, apparently it runs around 11V therefore saying how many mAh the battery has is not comparable to a cell phone battery which typically runs at 3.7v.

It will be using multiple cells to give a higher voltage. Wh is the most accurate measure of battery capacity in a device, higher voltage gives higher Wh for the same mAh. All phones I know of use only 1 cell so voltage is the same which makes mAh an accurate measure for phones.

But it&#39;s not there yet. The fact that you have to look up to access the control panel is going to be an issue for mobility-impaired people with spine problems. The fact that you can only have one Mac screen at a time isn&#39;t made up for by having the ability to open Vision OS apps. The lack of apps in general is a problem. I use multiple monitors and while I can get stuff done with one the productivity is severely hampered and we are talking stuff where no mobile app can do what I need. While hand-only control is cool you are going to want other interfaces for 3D control. Just like you can do certain things with a stylus there are things you can only do with a &quot;controller.&quot; Apple seems to not understand this it took 5 years of people saying the iPad needs a stylus for them to give us the Apple pencil. People have been saying the iPad Pro needs to run MacOS apps especially after it started getting the m series processors but my guess is it will be 5-10 years before they do that. And the same about some sort of device-based interface for Spatial interaction.  I see a lot of potential. But nothing here makes me think this is worth buying today. And the ecosystem thing doesn&#39;t matter to me. I don&#39;t want my message everywhere. I don&#39;t want my notifications everywhere.

Because the batteries might be a different voltage. I’m going to guess the Vision Pro battery is 11.4V while a cell phone battery is 3.8V. Watt-hours is the true objective measurement. It already accounts for voltage. So, you can see — in Watt-hours — the Vision Pro battery actually has comparable capacity to that Anker “1200mAh” power bank. Similar size. Makes sense. The Anker is running all of its cells in parallel. And I hope to god the Vision Pro battery is using lithium ion cylindrical cells, which have a very long lifespan, like 10+ years.

Which is the most important thing, having your moral up at your best while working. I can have private lectures with Einstein and my children for showing the children what is the most cool thing to think of while taking the elevator. Bro 😎 I’m betting the beginning of a new world right the moment Vision Pro is released. The advancement of technology will also bring everything together. Companies will make interfaces for everything. You can work from home as a Dj several nightclubs in the same time, or program with words, that’s real because it’s easy for a program to know where to put and how to arrange the punctuation of your programming language you just have to know what the large architecture of thing is.

            "{'comment_text': 'The moment WWDC finished I knew I was going to be first in line to get a Vision Pro. Here’s my use-case elements: (1) With an imbedded M2, Vision Pro is a replacement for the MacBook Pro. My MBP is very old, and I’ve been saving up for a replacement. A full-up MBP w/ M2 costs way more than a Vision Pro. The savings I’ll get will let me purchase a huge HDD or SDD. (2) I live in a VERY SMALL flat — basically 16 ft x 16 ft within an old house converted into a group home. This lets me save money, but real estate is at a premium. I don’t have room for multiple monitors. My 4K-UHD TV currently doubles as a monitor above my tiny desk. Vision Pro will replace that too, and allow me to post multiple monitors in the space around me in my bedroom/office. In addition to the multi-monitor workspace, I’ll be able to enjoy MASSIVE movie and sports venues, virtually. Even if I had unlimited space in my flat, though, I would choose Vision Pro over the installation of multiple large monitors, or a theater installation. (3) I took up a new career as a writer several years ago. I like working at coffee shops but most tables in such shops are tiny, barely providing room for my MBP, plus mouse, plus a spot for a coffee cup. There’s usually ZERO room for my handwritten notes to be placed alongside my Mac for me to transcribe my notes into my writing apps. Also, given that my writing has a social commentary element, I run the risk of someone glancing over my shoulder and deciding that I’m not a member of their tribe and verbally or physically assaulting me. Vision Pro will let me do my work invisibly, with ONLY my otherwise unreadable handwritten notes on the table with no need for my MBP or mouse taking up space. I’ll only need space for the smaller magic keyboard in front of me. Coffee shop work now becomes ergonomically efficient and safer. (4) My MetaQuest2 sits in my closet collecting dust because I found that VR games were a recipe for nausea. WWDC attendee’s testimony that motion-sickness was non-existent tells me that gaming might actually be viable for me with the Vision Pro, too. But even if it is not, reasons (1),(2), and (3) are completely sufficient to justify my waiting in line before the Apple Store opens early next year on release date.', 'author': '@rkarnes6304', 'likes': 0, 'timestamp': '2023-09-17T19:17:03Z'}\n",

            "{'comment_text': 'Any VR/AR/MR headsets made without the intention of allowing the use of controllers are pretty much soon-to-be-abandoned unless the companies behind them change their mind and finally release controllers which then turn them into money sinks for the consumers.<br><br>As much as the tech for detecting hands and simulating interaction can be cool to look at, I&#39;m sorry to say but as a game/app developer myself, they are always fundamentally dog crap because of this reason: Game engines will require special care uniquely for that precise device.<br><br>Let me point it out as really clear: For the most part VR in game engine are not some &quot;magical&quot; thing that is set up instantly when it comes to controllers. At the moment, VR/AR/MR is pretty much at the SAME stage as what we were before the release of the Xbox 360 controller on PCs where each device has its own set of controllers with generally the same minimalist layout (1 thumbstick, 2 buttons and 2 triggers per hand), but some have additional/function buttons or touch zone while others don&#39;t.<br><br>Take for example the Index capacitive sensors for the middle, ring and pinky fingers. While it&#39;s a really neat feature (that also drain your controller battery a lot more than anything else), you can almost count on both hands the number of apps and game that makes full use of it. That&#39;s because setting up the actual implementation of finger tracking is just a pain in the butt. And, by the way, the Index sensors for finger tracking is NOT from camera, but from a signal sent by the controller which reflects off the skin back. It allows limited detection of the position of the fingers and convert that data in to a float value representing how much a finger is flexing. (It doesn&#39;t detect the bone of the finger either, but simulate how much it should be bend.) Most game will only use the &quot;grip&quot; quick detection of the controller that return true or false depending on if the controller is tightly grippe or not. Valve actually had to update their API software to add that &quot;simplified option&quot; because it was just a pain to do it manually with their original setup.<br><br>Now, if the Apple Vision Pro offers hand and finger tracking, I can guaranty you that not even 5% of the games/apps will make full use of it. Almost everyone will use the &quot;Grip On/Off&quot; method that is used with other devices&#39; controller and avoid having to build the controls of that particular device that will most likely not even cover 2% of the VR/AR/MR market with its price tag.<br><br>It&#39;s the same with eyes tracking. It&#39;s not just some magical feature that get instantly added into any game. The devs got to script and understand how the device detects things and then implement eyes movement and/or focus movement in the game/app. If devs of a game or app don&#39;t see a massive point of adding eye tracking, then even with that massive amount of tech in eye tracking on the device&#39;s side, you&#39;ll still be force to move your head and not just your eyes regardless on the app side.<br>You might think that any devs who like their game will implement the eye tracking just because you, as their customers of their game, paid a crap ton of money for it, but the truth is that it might be on the bitter end of their &quot;may be added someday&quot; features because there are more pressing matter that cover more devices (hence more users) than the fraction that come using that tech<br><br>And that is IF that tech uses the SAME method as the other devices. Apple is well know for being &quot;different&quot; then the others by designing their own unique methods and basically telling devs: use our way or none. If you design an app for an iPhone, the program is different and run differently than on Android or a Console on many levels. If the Apple Vision Pro follows the same mentality, it will live the same life as the PS Vita with barely anything released on it after 1-2 years due to the headache that it might be to actually put something on it.', 'author': '@creationsmaxo', 'likes': 0, 'timestamp': '2023-08-29T16:14:35Z'}\n",

            "{'comment_text': 'Another con (for now, we&#39;ll see how far the devs can take this) is that while it is a seemingly stand-alone device, a lot of the features seems to be dependant on someone already being within the Apple ecosystem.  Requiring an iPhone to do facial scanning  (the headset has a bunch of depth sensors and an outward facing screen, it should be able to do facial scanning on its own), only working with Apple exclusive apps like Facetime and can only mirror screens from MacOS.  For someone like me who doesn&#39;t own any Apple devices there&#39;s not a lot of incentive when on top of paying the $3.5k I also have to pay thousands more to switch over to using iPhone and a Macbook to really take advantage of all the features of this headset.  The most I&#39;d be able to do is simulate a movie theatre and browse the web.<br><br>It could be very useful for privacy though.  If you&#39;re stuck using public transport or in any other kind of public setting you could watch whatever content, browse whatever websites, or do data sensitive work without the fear of someone peeking at your screen.  Then there&#39;s the other major problem of carrying this thing wherever you have to go.  That major problem to me is the reason why I think AR stuff is not going to really take off until the glasses/goggles are almost as simple to carry around and use as regular glasses.

Although the UNITY Engine is going to run on it and it will support gaming they are conceiving a wearable computer that interacts with the real world. Very bold and the patent portfolio really marks the territory.  Of course having the Mac ecosystem is a given, but what a given! It brings a world of familiarity and ease of use to the &quot;experiencer&quot;.  And just as the computer went from text to GUI and to 2D and 3D - this will build on that evolution. I&#39;d expect AI and AVATARs that on demand interact with the user and the environment. I believe Apple once called them &quot;Agents&quot; oh so many years ago.   To be more succinct - this is not a toy. Its a milestone. And since its bases upon iPhone and internal silicon technology I would bet this will be the usual $1499 when the volume ramps - and it will. The only thing close - Microsoft Hololense is a &quot;display&quot; technology and a good one; this is a leap to the next step.

But there is hand tracking and clicking the same way.

As you said, unfortunately, this product won&#39;t be for the masses just for a few, but I don&#39;t think this will be used for working-related tasks like they are trying to push it to. <br>Also, you can tell that this type of product is again a masiv data colector for the big corporate, as it will definetely track everything around your house whenever you will use it. <br>And of course not many will be interested on this product because there are no teachings or lessons about the new tech that are coming out lately...the masses barely know how to use their phones and laptops. Instead of making stupid TV shows by the corporates for the masses to keep their IQ level low, they should make some educational content about these new techs products.

Dad is never, ever cool. And right now, he&#39;s distracted by looking through a viewfinder. I think the Apple demo is less cool because it&#39;s passively recording an experience, whereas I&#39;m guessing the main usage of the recording tech is *interactive*, at least for the home movie set.

A boon for real estate folks, site surveyors and inspectors... I do a fair amount of work aiming expensive point to point radio gear across miles of distance. Being able to get live updates not only of heading and signal strength, but actual &quot;paintovers&quot; of the signal path, possible interferers or obstacles, or coverage area for point to multipoint connections. Heady stuff, and almost certainly a quick ROI for $3500 (okay, let&#39;s be real, $5K out the door) in terms of how much time it can save, even with a mere two hours of battery life. <br><br>Also, how <b>dare</b> you compare this to Google Glass. lol. The reason that tech was so hated was how invasive it was, while making a really lame effort to be &quot;stealthy&quot;. I can see Apple sidestepping this with various means of using the front screen to SHOW non-wearers that they are not being surveilled (you can see this a bit with the obscured-view overlay, and the virtual eyes mode). And, hey, if this product takes off in a big way, Apple can also make a few extra bucks selling $29 Apple BlurTags - just pop one in your pocket, and any Apple Vision devices will automatically obscure your face! Of course, that&#39;ll be a free feature for iPhone owners as well, with more granular controls... One more reason to join the ecosystem. ;)', 'author': '@deano1699', 'likes': 0, 'timestamp': '2023-06-07T10:09:24Z'}\n",

I have a specific question regarding the new Apple Vision headset that you recently tested.\\r<br>\\r<br>I have a lazy eye and I&#39;m very interested in how well this new headset might accommodate this. I currently have a PS5 with PSVR2, which has eye tracking. The eye tracking works well overall, but it can encounter issues when my lazy eye is offset. A feature that I think would be beneficial is the ability to designate one eye as the primary eye for tracking, which could potentially make it easier when looking at text or on-screen buttons.\\r<br>\\r<br>In your testing of the Apple Vision headset, did you come across any features or settings that could be adjusted to cater to someone with a lazy eye? Or perhaps, based on your extensive tech knowledge, do you know if this is something that can be handled effectively by VR/AR technology in general?\\r<br>\\r<br>This is a topic that doesn&#39;t often get discussed in tech reviews, but it&#39;s a crucial consideration for potential users like me.

If this had been presented to Jobs early in the design process, it’s not hard to imagine him shouting, “It needs to be untethered, it needs 10 hours minimum battery life and it needs to be under $500 - if you can’t do it, then can it.” Apple’s great strength was to make jaws drop at presentations with visionary products ready to use by the average consumer who didn’t realise they needed it until they saw it.

I got to thinking, in my garage I have an ebike that after taxes I paid just over $3000. For $600 more I could own this headset and it’s infinitely more useful then an ebike I ride once a months. As far as price vs value, it’s not horribly overpriced. <br><br>Of course I’ll likely not be buying this because for one I’m not a Mac user other then my phone and I think to really take full advantage you’d have to be completely Apple. This means a MacBook or other Apple computer, the iPhone and maybe even an Apple TV. I have none of those things. Do for me to take full advantage I’d have to buy the headset and at the very least a MacBook Air so I’m really in it for $5k minimum and for that kinda money I could do many many things that might be more valuable to me individually. <br><br>That said, I’ll definitely be trying one out if they do any demos at the Apple stores or if I have a friend that gets one. <br><br>Finally, I’m not one for being an early adopter, at least not at this price point. I’d like to wait until at least gen 2 before I consider buying in. <br><br>Anywhere we shall see how the launch goes and what people think of it when they finally get to spend some time with it. <br><br>Lastly, I agree with the whole 3D video thing! That was perhaps the single cringiest thing in the keynote. My friends and family would never let me forget walking around my daughters birthday with a vr headset shooting videos. <br><br>On a funny side note, wonder what some of these onlyfans girl might do with this tech?

Ability to zoom the field of vision in and out would be amazing too.

            "{'comment_text': '(wall of text)<br><br>I&#39;m still wondering how this compares to PSVR2. Yes, there&#39;s the Quest Pro... but I think the PSVR2 may be the closest to this if you remove stand alone aspect (important, but not the point at this moment). PSVR2 is insanely comfortable, very breathable so now swampy face, and the eye tracking system is near identical. It works super well and has the same calibration process of a bunch of dots that you look at to make sure things work. It also is very adjustable for different visions and such (and unlike this, PSVR2 works with glasses too). But one of the coolest aspects for me when I got PSVR2 was doing the basic calibration, and then it says to put it on... and my room showed up as if I didn&#39;t have a headset on. Now, it wasn&#39;t perfect and there was distortion + they&#39;re greyscale/infrared cameras. But I&#39;ve used a lot of VR headsets and that was a &quot;wait, what?&quot; moment as it worked so much better then nearly every other headset I&#39;ve used. Attach a phone + battery pack and have color cameras and you basically have this... yes, I&#39;m hand waving a lot of stuff such as the controllers. Marques noted not needing to put hands in a specific spot to make an action... my worry is basically every VR/AR system has made this claim, from cheap ones to expensive ones, and they all have a spot that can&#39;t be seen... and from the camera location, like existing systems, it&#39;s probably going to be the back of the head. That &quot;rest hands behind head and lean back&quot; moment that suddenly finds yourself unable to control it. If I had a controller... I could still click a button to do an action while using eye tracking. But once you need to track the location of my hand or a controller, behind the head is basically impossible unless the controller does it&#39;s own spacial location tracking independent of headset. And one place PSVR2/PS5 uses that eye tracking is with foveated rendering (the &quot;what you&#39;re looking at is detailed and everything else is not, to reduce compute power&quot;). To do a quick wrap up so I can finish watching this video, controllers are used for precision. It&#39;s to AR/VR what the Pen(cile) is to a tablet/phone. Not needed if the software is there, but very useful if you do. But that doesn&#39;t mean it can&#39;t have feedback... PSVR2 has vibration motors in the headset even. PSVR2 has fans to cool your face and wick away heat. It&#39;s balanced so it&#39;s comfortable on the head for hours at a time. Oh, finally an explainer for the wire. Everything said &quot;for charging&quot; and I went &quot;cool... why is the person doing the demo have a wire? Is this tethered or stand alone?&quot; All these things make me compare it to the PSVR2 instead of &quot;we upped the specs&quot; of a Quest 2 to Quest Pro.<br><br>The content comment is on point. I&#39;ll note that one thing our eyes do really well is focus... and cameras do not do that well post-recording (maybe light field recording...) but taking a kids birthday party with one of these... yea... that quality is going to be a potato sooner then you think. Not to mention: adult birthday, you&#39;re gonna be mocked... kids birthday, wait... you found a moment to not run around to find the candles and get the family/friends together, and the dog now needs to go out? When are you going to find that moment where you can sit still and get the good recording?<br><br>And given this isn&#39;t a phone or tablet or computer... how often will it get software updates? Is this $3500 that is a brick after 2 years? $3500 is enough to get nearly 9 TiltFives, 3 PSVR2 + PS5s, 2 Quest Pros... I don&#39;t know about the Quest Pro, but the TileFive is getting continuous updates and can get better systems with time. PSVR2+PS5 will get more and more optimized so it runs better.

Is the resolution keeping up? Can you actually see the pixels? I mean I don&#39;t care about the 23 mpx they claim, as I have the feeling the resolution is not enough. Don&#39;t get me wrong, my latest experience withe a headset was HTC vibe which was supposed to be very good when it was release and it was long time ago , but the resolution was awful, and very far away. Even doubling or tripling the resolution , it wouldn&#39;t be enough. The day they could make it retina, not noticing pixels anymore with night frequency I think it will be the day that we could swap monitors with a headset... But until then... So could you please throw some light into this?

            "{'comment_text': 'Thank you for your honest review!  From what you told here, I feel that Apple has chosen a rather conservative route - a high quality expansion of everyday screen uses, while making it a highly mobile and capeable solution at the same time. That&#39;s promising for actual screen work on tight spaces like airplanes, backseats of cars and inconvenient sourroundings like small hotel rooms. With the inclusion of haptic hardware, like a Keyboard and a Mouse, this can be a revolution for mobile working solutions that had to be solved by Laptops with limited eye to screen distance and screen size so far. Apple has made its homework with the most practical commercial usecases in mind, I&#39;m Impressed! For that you can get financial sound buyers, that are willing to accept that hefty price tag. Expecially with the well designed computing and pass through hardware included.<br>For the immersive 3-D Content: Picture and Movie Producers have tried that for 100 years now. Its always been impressive, but so far it never managed to survive the short lived &quot;Hype&quot; period. Maybe this time? But what does it actually add in use value? Of course, combined with the mobile working computer/simulated huge screen solution it comes more or less for &quot;free&quot;. Except for wearing inconvenience. Which killed shutter sycronised 3-D solutions with waaay lighter equipment on your head. <br>It seems like a milestone for highly capable mobile hardware - it has to become lighter and chaeper to reach a mass market but at least it is already useful as it is.

And is it preventable? It&#39;s got an internet connection, 12 cameras, connections with other devices, developer applications ...<br>2. Does it heat up depending on how many &quot;screens&quot; are open?<br>3. What would a software crash look like, will it freeze the Vision Pro or only the software window that was opened up? <br>4. Where&#39;s Siri? And how could one use Siri with this product?<br>5. What&#39;s the repair look like on one of these? Outside screen, inside screens, camera malfunction?<br>6. What types of careers/industries will be promoted that will use the Vision Pro?<br>7. Does it have it&#39;s own storage and how much is the User limited to? Or will they let the user choose how much storage it comes with when purchasing?<br>8. Does a product like the Vision Pro already exist, BUT on the east coast? Those 5,000 patents would proect apple of course so idk ... maybe.<br><br>Predictions I have for Apple Vision Pro:<br>1. Different &quot;Profiles&quot; that you&#39;re able to sign in with the device using Optic ID. As well as customizable UI or Profile Cusomization options. <br>2. A seperate &quot;stand&quot; for the Vision Pro that Apple will sell.<br>3. Like you mentioned Marques, courtside seats at sport games/events ... hopefully for $50 lol.<br>4. Events/Concerts/Webinars etc. tickets that are only exclusive to the ones who purchased the Vision Pro.<br>5. The day Siri turns its AI switch on and gets to know more about the USER and asks them questions about their day. (On/Off feature of course ... hopefully lol)<br>6. The ability to scan paper documents in front of you and save them onto the Vision Pro storage or something.<br>7. Apple Vision Pro Color Options.<br>8. Apple Vision Pro Cases.<br>9. A warning/time limit notification that is shown before the device gets turned on. <br>10. Vision Pro UI converted apps (Final Cut, Garage Band, iMovie, YouTube).<br>11. Sharable iCloud storage that is connected inside the Vision Pro Device.<br>12. Crazy apps that these developers will create for different careers/industries.

I also think the Apple approach to try and create a socially acceptable headset is undoubtably key for getting Apple (mainstream) customers onboard and it does uniquely set them apart from other headsets. Apple however have left the competition a lot of time, budget, and out of the box capability to develop headsets that undercut the Vision Pro. Assuming here that Apple didn&#39;t just develop this headset to become 5000 patent hell for the competition.<br><br>Out of the box Vision Pro is not a strong VR gaming/experience device. It doesn&#39;t come with a gaming controller (you need to buy separately), and for full VR immersion they have not demonstrated the guardian (play area) system. So far it&#39;s been marketed as device for more passive VR experiences.<br><br>In the passive VR space to watch movies there will be competition from brands like Big Screen. A tiny VR headset dedicated to passive movie experiences.<br><br>AR is where Apple wants this thing to shine with the high res screens and quality passthrough. If they can make the VisionPro a stand alone computer that can replace the productivity functions of an ipad + keyboard then that would be a good win. Gut feeling is they won&#39;t want it to cannibalise  Mac sales.<br><br>At $3500 it&#39;s a big ask and a big risk.

The hardest part in my opinion about 3D is how unintuitive it can be to use a keyboard and mouse. People obviously learn this and make amazing stuff but for my needs I just want it to feel intuitive and it just is not, it&#39;s very technical and hard to do it well. The smallest things can become big roadblocks for me. I&#39;m not looking to be a great 3D animator, mostly just modeling and sculpting.<br><br>BUT Gravity sketch on the quest 2 has been an amazing way to actually use my hands to 3D model. All of a sudden you are there standing with your 3D model using your hands, not a keyboard and mouse. So creating and modifying what you&#39;re working on is FAR better in my opinion. It&#39;s like you&#39;re actually touching what you&#39;re making and manipulating it with your hands instead of looking at what you&#39;re making through a window (your monitor) at a control board (your keyboard/mouse). But the quest 2 is limited in what it can do and the screen isn&#39;t great. And gravity sketch is a great 3D sketching program with real polygons that you can take into c4d, but that software is limited too by what the quest can do.<br><br>So as a 2D artist that has always had all apple stuff and desperately wants to enjoy 3D work, I recognize that this vision pro might just tick all the boxes I need to be able to intuitively enjoy 3D. And if I can wrangle that into my professional work, it would probably pay for itself after one client project. Plus this thing is still less than a pro XDR display, and that&#39;s just an accurate impressive looking screen.<br><br>Yes it&#39;s expensive but standard processes create standard results. I want a unique process to create unique results.', 'author': '@lusenator', 'likes': 0, 'timestamp': '2023-06-06T20:24:23Z'}\n",

The Face time aspect of not needing to hold up a phone, could be useful for people like me who have arm weakness and can&#39;t really hold up their phone and getting one of those octopus stands is soo jenky or even to difficult to move around. Like pretty much every part of this, I can see as being really good for people with disabilities who at the moment struggle with a lot of technology, because a lot of it isn&#39;t really designed for us. <br><br>Also the ability to watch games court side kind of helps two groups of people at the same time, disabled people and people who cannot afford court side games in the slightest. It lets them enjoy the game from the best angle as well without costing nearly as much. But not only that, a lot of disabled friends of mine who enjoy Baseball, soccer, basketball, etc can&#39;t go to games because quite frankly there&#39;s very little accessibility for them and their needs. So if the Vision Pro allows them to link up multiple vision&#39;s together and enjoy the game &quot;court-side&quot; with their friends and family, that would completely boggle their mind and give them an experience they would have never had the opportunity to experience. <br><br>Even as a first generation tech from apple, I can see this being exceptionally useful for people with disabilities, and if this is the first iteration, I can&#39;t even imagine what the 2nd and 3rd gen will end up looking like.', 'author': '@FMLPanda123', 'likes': 0, 'timestamp': '2023-06-06T19:55:11Z'}\n",

That doesn&#39;t change the fact that it costs $3500; I expect that in about three years, Apple will update the Pro with the latest M-class processor and some other new features, and the device that was announced yesterday will become just &quot;Apple Vision&quot; without the Pro moniker, and cost around $2000, in the same way that older iPhones stay in the lineup as budget models when new top-of-line devices are released.', 'author': '@scottmartin5492', 'likes': 77, 'timestamp': '2023-06-06T19:43:25Z'}\n",
